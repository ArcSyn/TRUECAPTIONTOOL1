# 🔒 Making Your Repository Private

## Quick Steps to Make Repository Private

### Through GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to your repository** on GitHub.com
2. **Click on "Settings"** tab (far right in the repository navigation)
3. **Scroll down to "Danger Zone"** at the bottom of the page
4. **Click "Change repository visibility"**
5. **Select "Make private"**
6. **Confirm by typing the repository name** when prompted
7. **Click "I understand, change repository visibility"**

### Alternative: Through GitHub CLI (if you have gh installed)

```bash
# Make repository private
gh repo edit --visibility private

# Verify the change
gh repo view --json visibility
```

## Important Considerations for Private Repositories

### 🔐 Access Control
- **Only you and invited collaborators** can see the repository
- **GitHub Actions minutes** may be limited based on your plan
- **GitHub Pages** sites will become private (if applicable)

### 👥 Collaborator Management
- **Existing collaborators** will retain access
- **New collaborators** must be explicitly invited
- **Consider team permissions** if this is an organization repository

### 📦 Package Registry
- **npm packages** published from private repos may need configuration updates
- **Container images** may need access token updates

### 🔗 Links and References
- **Update any public links** that reference this repository
- **Documentation links** in other projects may need updating
- **CI/CD pipelines** may need access token updates

## Recommended Next Steps After Making Private

1. **Review collaborator access** - Remove any unnecessary access
2. **Update documentation** - Remove any references to public repository
3. **Check integrations** - Ensure CI/CD and third-party services still work
4. **Update badges** - Any shields.io badges may need updating
5. **Consider branch protection** - Set up branch protection rules for main
